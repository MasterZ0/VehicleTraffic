This game was a test proposed for a job involving work in Unreal. The objective was to create an NPC vehicle that travels along a highway and implement several features, including:

- Create a vehicle that moves through splines in a non-deterministic way
- Detect curves and randomly choose whether to follow them or turn in a different direction
- Add traffic light behavior with the following rules:
  - Green: Continue driving
  - Yellow: Increase speed
  - Red: Stop
- Implement a fuel system and make the car stop when it runs out
- Perform Drifts on specific curves and add points to the score when it occurs
- Add a UI displaying the fuel level, score and current speed.
- The player controls a standard character to observe the vehicle's behavior.
